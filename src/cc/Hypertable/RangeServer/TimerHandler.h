  /// RequestHandlerDoMaintenance object onto the application queue each
  /// time it is called.  However, it also tests for low memory and if
  /// detected, will cause the maintenance prioritization algorithm to change
  /// to aggressively free memory.  It also pauses the application queue
  /// to allow maintenance to catch up if it gets behind.

    /// threshold, m_max_app_queue_pause to the property
